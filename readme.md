# [gatsby-source-google-scholar](https://gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-google-scholar)

[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) source plugin for pulling metadata on scientific publications from [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com).

## [Live Demo](https://gatsby-source-google-scholar.netlify.com)

[See the `example` directory for the demo's source code](https://github.com/janosh/gatsby-source-google-scholar/tree/master/example).

## Install

```sh
yarn add gatsby-source-google-scholar
```

## Usage

Include the plugin in your `gatsby-config` and specify your queries.

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    ...
  },
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-google-scholar`,
      options: {
        queries: [`richard feynman`, `albert einstein`],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Specify the metadata you need in a GraphQL query. Here's everything available.

```graphql
{
  allGoogleScholar {
    nodes {
      id
      title
      url
      authors {
        name
        url
      }
      preEtAl
      postEtAl
      abstract
      year
      journal
      pdfUrl
      citedByCount
      citedByUrl
      relatedUrl
      allVersionsUrl
    }
  }
}
```

If you're only interested in the results for one of your queries, simply filter your results like so:

```graphql
{
  pubs: allGoogleScholar(
    filter: { internal: { query: { eq: "richard feynman" } } }
  ) {
    nodes {
      title
      url
    }
  }
}
```

`preEtAl` and `postEtAl` are booleans indicating whether Google used ellipsis to signal additional authors before or after the list of authors matching your query, as in this example:

![pre- and post et Al.](https://i.imgur.com/W1IHjDR.png)

Here's an example of the data you'll get.

## Known Issues

The HTTP response received from `request` seems to break HTML entity encoding. As a result some special characters (like German umlauts) are currently not displayed correctly. PRs welcome!
